# Weather-Dashboard

Once again, attempting to code from scratch. This is still very difficult for me.  (04-05-2024)

This project is late.  I tried to build this from a template that was part of a github class activity. I found it too hard to reverse engineer it into what I wanted.

So I started over.

It's done, but having trouble getting the buttons for the history of the cities that I searched the weather for.  It currently looks like this:

I'm not sure how much more I can do sinces it's already late
